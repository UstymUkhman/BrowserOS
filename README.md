## ‚ùî What Is This ##

Bare minimal JavaScript GUI for an x64 Linux OS. It uses [linux.js](https://github.com/MainSilent/linux.js), a debian based linux distro under the hood and an Electron app with TypeScript + SolidJS to interact and build a UI on top of it.

## üòï But Why? ##

Because sometimes all you need is ~~love~~ a browser and... why not?

### ‚ú® Features ###

- Built with web technologies.

- No telemetry or other bloatware.

- Safe by default since everything is in a sandbox.

- Light and dark theme.

- Very minimal, Chromium based, web browser.

- Clock with date & time. But it's in JavaScript, so take it with a grain of salt.

### ‚ùó Limitations ###

- Built with web technologies.

- No filesystem. Could be probably implemented though.

- Does not work on Windows WSL2. Related [issue](https://github.com/MainSilent/linux.js/issues/2).

- Electron `v9.4.4` and (because of this) Chromium `v83.0.4103.122`. So no scoped CSS or others (relatively) new features. üòû Related issues: [#20086](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/20086#issuecomment-1649775507), [#17049](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/17049) and [#19847](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/19847).
